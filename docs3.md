# Subscriptions Module Documentation

This documentation covers the `Subscriptions` module, which consists of several classes and methods to handle various aspects of subscription management within a system. This module is part of a larger application presumably dealing with customer subscriptions, meal plans, diet recommendations, etc.

## Classes and Modules

### Subscriptions::Listener

`Subscriptions::Listener` is a listener class that includes `Wisper::Publisher` to subscribe to certain events related to subscription processes. It is responsible for handling events like successful order charge or failed charge and thereby initiating particular actions like incrementing renewal counts or pausing subscriptions.

**Methods:**

- `initialize(subscription)`: Constructor that takes a `subscription` object and registers listeners for specific events.

**Events Handled:**

- `order_charged_successfully(charge_id)`: Increments the renewal count and broadcasts a successful renewal event.
- `order_charge_failed(charge, error_message, exception)`: Handles subscription renewals that failed to process which can potentially lead to subscription pausing depending on the failure count.

### Subscriptions::Statistics

`Subscriptions::Statistics` module calculates statistics for subscriptions based on their states by a given date.

**Methods:**
 
- `stats_by_date(end_date)`: Calculates and returns subscription statistics for a given `end_date`.
  
### Subscriptions::ChangeMealsStockImporter

`Subscriptions::ChangeMealsStockImporter` is responsible for updating subscription meal line items based on stock availability from a CSV file input.

**Methods:**

- `initialize(csv_path)`: Constructor taking a path to the CSV file.
- `validate`: Validates the CSV file content.
- `call`: Processes the CSV file and updates subscriptions accordingly.
- `print_results`: Outputs the results to the log.

### Subscriptions::LineItem
`Subscriptions::LineItem` is a value object representing a line item in a subscription order. It includes attributes such as SKU, quantity, price, type, and if it's recurring.

### Subscriptions::LineItemSet
`Subscriptions::LineItemSet` is a collection of `Subscriptions::LineItem` objects and includes methods for deserialization, initialization, and getting a subset of recurring items.

### Subscriptions::Commands::ChangePhoto
Handles the command to update a pet's photo within a subscription.

### Subscriptions::Commands::RemovePhoto
Handles the command to remove a pet's photo from a subscription.

### Subscriptions::Commands::IgnoreNewPlanRecommendations
Handles the command to ignore new plan recommendations in a subscription.

### Subscriptions::Commands::ChangePlan
Handles the command to change a subscription plan based on provided SKU and admin mode flag.

### Subscriptions::Commands::HideSubscription
Handles the command to set a subscription as hidden or unhidden.

### Subscriptions::Jobs::UpdateDailySubscriptionStatsJob
A background job that updates subscription statistics on a daily basis.

### Subscriptions::LineItemMapper
Responsible for mapping subscription line items to different categories, such as meals or addons.

### Subscriptions::LegacyMapper
Includes various class methods to aid in old-to-new system migrations involving fulfillment schedules and billing information.

### Subscriptions::Models::LineItemsAttribute
ActiveRecord type extension to assist in the serialization/deserialization process of `LineItemSet` objects.

### Subscriptions::AutomaticRescheduler
A service to automatically reschedule subscription dates if the last order's shipping date is too close to the next scheduled date.

### Subscriptions::Commands::ChangePhoto
Handles the operation of changing the photo in a subscription based on the subscription number and provided photo data.

### Subscriptions::Commands::RemovePhoto
Manages the removal of photos in a subscription based on the given subscription number.

### Subscriptions::Commands::IgnoreNewPlanRecommendations
Updates the subscription to ignore new plan recommendations based on the subscription number and a flag indicating whether to ignore or not.

### Subscriptions::Commands::ChangePlan
Allows changes to a subscription's plan by specifying the subscription number, selected plan SKU, and whether it's in admin mode or not.

### Subscriptions::Commands::HideSubscription
Enables or disables visibility of a subscription by providing the subscription number and a flag to hide or unhide the subscription.

### Subscriptions::Jobs::UpdateDailySubscriptionStatsJob
Performs daily updates of subscription statistics.

## Usage

Each class and module offers functionalities that intertwine to form a cohesive subscription management system. This system performs tasks such as updating meal plans depending on stock availability, handling subscription photo assets, reacting to subscription changes, and maintaining subscription health through statistics and automatic rescheduling.

When using this module, one should be aware of the specific roles and responsibilities of each class and method to effectively integrate them into the larger application context.

**Example:**
```ruby
# Update daily stats for subscriptions
Subscriptions::Jobs::UpdateDailySubscriptionStatsJob.new.perform
```

This should give a clear understanding of the Subscription module and its capabilities. The actual implementation may vary based on the specifics of the system in which it is integrated.
