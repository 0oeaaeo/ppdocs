## React Components and Hooks

### StyledComponentsRegistry

```tsx
export default function StyledComponentsRegistry({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  // implementation
}
```

- Description: A component that manages the inclusion of server-side rendered styles for styled-components, enabling them to be rehydrated on the client.
- Parameters:
  - `children`: React nodes to be wrapped within the `StyleSheetManager`.
- Usage: Intended for use with Next.js's Server Component API (`'use client'`) to handle server-inserted HTML through `useServerInsertedHTML` hook.

### useBreeds

```tsx
export default function useBreeds() {
  const { data } = useQuery(QUERY_GQL_BREEDS);
  return { breeds: data?.fetchBreeds || [] };
}
```

- Description: A custom React hook to fetch breeds using the GraphQL `QUERY_GQL_BREEDS` query.
- Returns: An object containing `breeds`, which is an array of breed data or an empty array if no data is available.

### useContinueHandler

```tsx
export default function useContinueHandler() {
  // implementation
  return goToNext;
}
```

- Description: A custom React hook to handle the navigation for a multi-step subscription process. 
- Returns: A `goToNext` function to navigate to the next step based on the current path.

### useFulfillmentScheduleDates

```tsx
export default function useFulfillmentScheduleDates() {
  const { data } = useQuery(FETCH_FULFILLMENT_SCHEDULE_DATES);
  return {
    fulfillmentScheduleDates: data?.fetchFulfillmentScheduleDates || []
  };
}
```

- Description: A custom React hook to fetch fulfillment schedule dates using the GraphQL `FETCH_FULFILLMENT_SCHEDULE_DATES` query.
- Returns: An object containing `fulfillmentScheduleDates`, which is an array of dates or an empty array if no data is available.

[... (Other Hooks)](#other-hooks)

- Description: There are other custom hooks similar to `useBreeds` and `useFulfillmentScheduleDates` that are designed to fetch or mutate data using predefined GraphQL operations.
- Examples: `useIngredients`, `usePaymentBatch`, `usePaymentMethods`, `usePayments`, `useRecipes`, `useReportJobs`, `useRouteSchedules`, `useShipmentLineItemsPreviewJob`, `useShipmentLineItemsReportJob`, `useShipmentList`, `useTerms`, `useUniqueFulfillmentScheduleDates`, `useWellnessGoals`, `useZipCodes`.

## Utility and Helper Functions

### Session Cart Helpers

- `findOrCreateCart`: Function to retrieve the current session cart or redirect to the cart initialization endpoint.
- `getSessionCart`: Asynchronous function to get the current session cart from cookies.
- `PetPlateCart`: Type alias for a non-null or undefined return type of `findOrCreateCart`.

### Error Handling

- `handleMutationError`: Function to handle errors that occur during GraphQL mutations and set form errors accordingly.
- `GraphQLErrorResponse`: Type definition for responses containing GraphQL errors.

### Cookie Helpers

- `readCookie`: Isomorphic method to retrieve cookie values in both client and server environment.

- Parameters:
  - `condition`: A boolean indicating whether the page scroll should be blocked.

## GraphQL Queries and Mutations (Detailed)

### Queries

Each query defined is a string literal wrapped in a `gql` template tag provided by 'Apollo Client'. The query is usually named after its functionality, e.g. `FETCH_CART` fetches cart-related data. Below are the detailed explanations of the GraphQL queries/hooks exported in the codebase:

- `FETCH_CART`: Fetches details of a specific shopping cart including line items data.
- `FETCH_UNIQUE_FULFILLMENT_SCHEDULE_DATES`: Retrieves a list of unique fulfillment schedule dates.
- `FETCH_FULFILLMENT_SCHEDULE_DATES`: Acquires a list of fulfillment schedule dates with details like delivery date, shipping day, status, and zip code.
- `FETCH_CARTS`: Retrieves a list of shopping carts, used for administrative or user profile layouts.
- `FETCH_REPORT_JOBS`: Fetches a list of reporting jobs for backend processing.
- `QUERY_GQL_BREEDS`: Gets a list of animal breeds (specific to PetPlate services).
- `QUERY_GQL_INGREDIENTS`: Retrieves details on various food ingredients available.
- `QUERY_GQL_WELLNESS_GOALS`: Fetches wellness goals that can be set within the PetPlate service.
- `QUERY_GQL_RECIPES`: Acquires recipes information.
- `QUERY_GQL_PAYMENTS`: Lists payments.
- `QUERY_GQL_PAYMENT`: Provides detailed information on a specific payment.
- `QUERY_GQL_TERMS`: Fetches terms and conditions.
- `QUERY_GQL_TERM`: Retrieves a specific term by ID.
- `QUERY_GQL_PAYMENT_METHODS`: Gets a list of payment methods.
- `QUERY_GQL_PAYMENT_METHOD`: Fetches a specific payment method by ID.
- `QUERY_GQL_ROUTE_SCHEDULES`: Retrieves route schedules, likely used for delivery planning.
- `QUERY_GQL_ZIP_CODES`: Gets a list of zip codes, potentially for delivery areas.
- `QUERY_GQL_ZIP_CODE`: Fetches a specific zip code by ID.

### Mutations

Similar to queries, mutations are also wrapped in a `gql` template tag. They are designed to execute actions that modify data on the backend. Here are the details:

- `WRITE_CART`: Mutation to create or update a shopping cart.
- `CREATE_PAYMENT_BATCH`: Generates a new payment batch for processing transactions.
- `CREATE_SHIPMENT_LIST`: Creates a shipment list likely used for coordinating deliveries.
- `CREATE_SHIPMENT_LINE_ITEMS_PREVIEW_JOB`: Initiates a job to preview shipment line items, perhaps for administrative confirmation before processing.
- `CREATE_SHIPMENT_LINE_ITEMS_REPORT_JOB`: Starts a reporting job for shipment line items, probably for backend processing and auditing.
